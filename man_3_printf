.SH NAME
.B _printf
- a simplified printf which takes a format string and prints data with allowed specifiers in the standard output returning number of characters printed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"
.PP
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This _printf is a partially working printf because it doesn't take all of the specifiers printf usually takes.
.PP
It only takes 5 format specifiers which can be printed in the standard output.
.PP
The non-allowed specifiers will just be considered as regular characters and % with letter of specifier will be printed in the standard output.
.PP
The function will print string inputed as well as all arguments if any of allowed specifiers and return total number of printed characters.
.SH RETURN
If the function takes NULL or '%' only as inputed format, it will cause an error and will return (-1) as fail indication.
.PP
If the function is successful, it will return (count) an integer of the total number of characters printed in the standard output.
.SH FORMAT
The format string is composed zero or more directives: it can hold only a simple string or contains '%' specifiers. 
.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS
.I %c
The %c format specifier is used to print out a single character.
.PP
.I %s
The %s format specifier is used to print out a string of characters.
.I %%
The %% format specifier is used to print out a percentage symbol.
.I %d
The %d format specifier is used to print out a decimal integer (base 10).
.I %i
The %i format specifier is used to print out a decimal integer (base 10).
.SH EXAMPLE
#include "main.h"
